# Cuisine Roulette - Enhanced Second Wheel System

## Overview
This project has been transformed from a "Restaurant Roulette" to a more robust "Cuisine Roulette" system with an improved second wheel that works reliably without depending on external APIs.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Two-Wheel System**
- **First Wheel**: Cuisine selection (Italian, Mexican, Chinese, etc.) - works perfectly as before
- **Second Wheel**: Now shows specific **dishes and food options** within the selected cuisine instead of restaurants

### 2. **Robust Second Wheel Features**
- **Comprehensive Food Database**: 8+ options per cuisine with detailed descriptions
- **Rich Metadata**: Each option includes:
  - Emoji icons for visual appeal
  - Popularity ratings (1-5 scale)
  - Spice levels for applicable cuisines
  - Dietary information (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free)
  - Detailed descriptions

### 3. **Improved User Experience**
- **No External Dependencies**: No more reliance on restaurant APIs that might fail
- **Instant Loading**: Second wheel loads immediately with pre-defined options
- **Visual Enhancements**: Better wheel design with emojis, better spacing, and improved animations
- **Smart Randomization**: Options are intelligently shuffled while maintaining popular choices
- **Refresh Options**: Users can get new sets of options for the same cuisine

### 4. **Technical Improvements**
- **Better State Management**: Clean separation between cuisine and restaurant wheel states
- **Enhanced Store**: Added proper cuisine wheel state management in Zustand store
- **Modular Architecture**: Created reusable cuisine options system
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety for all new components

## How It Works Now

1. **Step 1**: User spins the main wheel to select a cuisine (e.g., "Italian")
2. **Step 2**: The cuisine wheel automatically appears with 8 specific options (e.g., "Pizza Margherita", "Spaghetti Carbonara", "Risotto", etc.)
3. **Step 3**: User spins the cuisine wheel to get a specific dish recommendation
4. **Result**: User gets a final recommendation like "üçï Pizza Margherita - Classic Italian pizza with tomato, mozzarella, and basil"

## Features per Cuisine

Each cuisine now includes 8 carefully curated options:

- **Italian**: Pizza, Pasta dishes, Risotto, Tiramisu, etc.
- **Mexican**: Tacos, Guacamole, Enchiladas, Churros, etc.
- **Chinese**: Sweet & Sour Pork, Dim Sum, Hot Pot, etc.
- **Indian**: Butter Chicken, Biryani, Tandoori, etc.
- **Thai**: Pad Thai, Green Curry, Tom Yum, etc.
- **Japanese**: Sushi, Ramen, Tempura, etc.
- **And more...**

## Technical Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Radix UI** components
- **Canvas Confetti** for celebrations

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Reliability**: No more failed API calls or empty restaurant lists
2. **Speed**: Instant loading of cuisine options
3. **Completeness**: Always 8 quality options per cuisine
4. **Educational**: Users learn about different dishes and their characteristics
5. **Accessibility**: Works offline and doesn't require location permissions
6. **Customizable**: Easy to add new cuisines and dishes

## Running the Project
